Customers using Managed Environments for Sitecore are given a fully customizable dedicated environment designed by experts at Rackspace, allowing you to focus on producing the best web content for your application or website

While Rackspace manages your Sitecore environment, the following processes and concepts give customers greater control and direction over their Sitecore environment.

### Sitecore and Azure

Sitecore runs on Windows .NET webservers, hosted on Azure webapps. Therefore, all Rackspace Sitecore environments use Azure credentials to make changes to a Sitecore environment. Through the Azure portal, you can:

- Get the URL to your content management website
- Reset deployment credentials
- Restart their website or application
- Access logs

If you want to make changes to your Sitecore environment, log in to the [Azure portal]((https://portal.azure.com/) using the credentials sent to you by Rackspace.

**Note:** You can not delete your application or website through the Azure portal. To delete your application, contact [Rackspace Support](https://www.rackspace.com/en-us/information/contactus).
