We offer a number of email migration services to our customers at no
charge. Our team of email migration experts are here to help you in case
you have any questions or concerns.

### External migration services

If you are a new customer and require email data to be migrated from another provider, we can help. We provide two migration
support options to make your transition as easy as possible.

#### Option 1: Self-service migration

Run your migration at any time of the day or night with MigrationWiz, which is available within the Cloud Office Control Panel. [Click here for instructions](/how-to/migrate-your-email-by-using-the-self-service-migration-tool/).

The benefits of using the self-migration tool:

-   Migrate from any provider to Hosted Exchange, Rackspace Email, or Rackspace Office 365
-   Includes a no-cost migration
-   Migrates contacts, calendars, tasks, and notes data when moving from
    Exchange to Exchange
-   Provides real-time email notifications through the migration process
-   Direct access to view your migration status
-   Can be accessed from any Internet browser
-   24x7 ***Fanatical Support***<sup>&reg;</sup> provided by a team of email experts

Note: Current customers seeking to upgrade to our Office 365 solution should review [Rackspace Email and Microsoft Exchange upgrade to Office 365 FAQ](/how-to/rackspace-email-and-microsoft-exchange-upgrade-to-office-365-faq/) for questions and instructions on the process.

#### Option 2: Assisted migration

Assisted migrations are ideal for companies that need help consulting,
planning, and scheduling a migration project. Our assisted migration
service will provide you with peace of mind knowing that your migration
is being coordinated by the best team of email migration experts.

The benefits of choosing an assisted migration are as follows:

-   A migration specialist dedicated to your project
-   A custom migration plan based on consultation with your specialist
-   A scheduled time slot with your specialist to perform your migration
-   Timely updates from your specialist throughout the process
-   Documentation and recommendations on managing the migration for your
    end-users

Assisted Migrations are a partnership between your company and our
team of experts. Throughout the process we will require some action and
information from you.

Migrations vary based on the type of mailboxes we are migrating to and
from. See the following chart for a list of what will migrate using
our services:
