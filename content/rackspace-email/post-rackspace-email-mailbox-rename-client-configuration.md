Once you have renamed a Rackspace Email mailbox, your devices will no longer connect to the mailbox. This is because they are trying to connect to the old mailbox name.

This article outlines the steps to connect your devices to your newly renamed Rackspace Email mailbox. If you have not yet renamed the mailbox and require instructions, see [Rename a Rackspace Email mailbox](/how-to/rename-a-rackspace-email-mailbox/).

### Prerequisites

- **Applies to:** User or administrator
- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Time needed:** Approximately 20 minutes
- **Tools required:**  Mailbox password and access to the devices you want to connect

For more information about prerequisite terminology, see [Cloud Office support terminology](/how-to/cloud-office-support-terminology/).

It is always best practice to export a copy of your mailbox from your [local mail client](/how-to/cloud-office-support-terminology/) when making configuration changes. This is a precaution to avoid losing any data.
