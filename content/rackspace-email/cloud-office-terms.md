### Cloud Office Support Terms


#### Cloud Office support article prerequisites

- **Applies to –** Specifies an audience the article is written for.  It will apply to User or Administrator.

    - *User -* In the context of support, a user has access to our product (Example: [apps.rackspace.com](apps.rackpsace.com)) but does not have access to administrator tools (Example: Cloud Office Control Panel). Articles that specify users as the audience do not make recommendations that require administrator tools.

    - *Administrator -* This article will discuss a topic that may require access to administrator tools (Example: Cloud Office Control Panel).

    *Note: An article that applies to a “User” is still valuable information for an administrator as an administrator may also be a “User”.*

- **Difficulty –** A subjective evaluation of difficulty for achieving resolution of that topic.

    - *Easy -* The article is instructional and involves minimal or no troubleshooting.

    - *Moderate -* This article is instructional but will require troubleshooting or access to tools not at Rackspace Cloud Office (Example: You are configuring your DNS records and your DNS is hosted at GoDaddy. You will need to access your GoDaddy account).

    - *Challenging -* This article is almost entirely troubleshooting.

- **Time needed -** An approximation of time needed to complete the steps in the article if you have access to all required tools. This approximation does not account for unforeseen obstacles.

    Examples of unforeseen obstacles:<br>
    Password recovery<br>
    Internet connectivity issues<br>
    Local network configuration<br>
    Third-party application troubleshooting<br>
    </p>

- **Required tools -** An outline of the minimum tools required to complete the steps listed in an article. Required tools can refer to level of access, software, or additional hardware.

    <p>
    Examples of required tools:<br>
    Offending device: The device that is experiencing an issue.<br>
    Non-primary computer: A computer different from the one you are experiencing issues on.<br>
    Non-primary internet network: An internet network different from the one you are experiencing issue on.<br>
    Internet access<br>
    Access to multiple computers or mobile devices for troubleshooting<br>
