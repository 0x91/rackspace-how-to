### Backing up the mailbox

It is always best practice to export a copy of your mailbox from your [local mail client](/how-to/cloud-office-support-terminology/) when making configuration changes to avoid losing any data.

### Post-email address rename FAQ

#### I renamed my Rackspace Email address, but now Outlook and my phone are not receiving messages. How do I fix this?

Your devices are not receiving mail because they are configured to connect using the old email address. If you log in at [apps.rackspace.com](apps.rackspace.com) using the new email address, you will see the mailbox is still receiving mail. Select your mail client in [Desktop clients](#desktop-clients) or [Mobile clients](#mobile-clients) for specific instructions.

#### I followed the configuration instructions and now I am missing mail! What happened?

As we recommend you should always back up local data before making changes. In many cases this is not something to worry about. If you are missing mail data, it may be the case that your old configuration was storing data locally to your device. As long as you backed up the data, you can import it into the new configuration.

#### Is mail sent to the old email address be delivered to my new email address?

Yes. When a mailbox is renamed, an alias of the old email address is automatically created to direct email to your new email address.

#### Did my password changed now that I have a new email address?

No. It is recommended to change your password regularly to keep your account secure, but the rename process does not change the password.

### Connect to the newly renamed mailbox

After you have backed up the mail data locally, you are ready to connect to the renamed mailbox. Use the following instructions for your mail client.
