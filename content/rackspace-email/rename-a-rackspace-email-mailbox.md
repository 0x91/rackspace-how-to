This article explains how to rename a Rackspace Email mailbox from the Cloud Office Control Panel.


### Prerequisites

- **Applies to:** User
- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Time needed:** Approximately 20 minutes
- **Tools required:** Control Panel access, All devices currently connected to the mailbox

For more information about prerequisite terminology, see [Cloud Office support terminology](/how-to/cloud-office-support-terminology).

### Before you begin

If the mailbox is set up in a [local email client](/how-to/cloud-office-support-terminology) profile such as Outlook or Apple Mail, you should export the user's local profile. After the mailbox is renamed, the local profile must be recreated. Exporting the profile before renaming the mailbox prevents the loss of mail data.

### Rename a Rackspace Email mailbox

1. Log into the [Cloud Office Control Panel](https://cp.rackspace.com/).

2. In the **Rackspace Email** section, click on the link for **Mailboxes**.

3. In the mailbox list, click the link for the mailbox name which you would like to rename.

    - Note: `This email address is already taken`, means the address is already in use as an alias, group list, distribution list, or as a Microsoft Exchange mailbox on this domain. Try a different address.

6. A confirmation message will appear, displaying the old email address and the new email address. If the change is correct, click **OK**.

### Update devices to connect to the renamed mailbox

Once the mailbox has been renamed, you must update all devices such as desktop computers and mobile phones to connect to the renamed mailbox. See [Renamed Rackspace Email address setup guide](/how-to/renamed-rackspace-email-address-setup-guide/) for next steps.

Note: We recommend logging into [apps.rackspace.com](https://apps.rackspace.com/index.php) with the new mailbox address before configuring devices. If you are unable to log in, updated the mailbox password before continuing. See [Change a Rackspace Email mailbox password](/how-to/change-rackspace-email-mailbox-password/#change-a-password-through-cloud-office-control-panel) if you are unable to log into the mailbox.
