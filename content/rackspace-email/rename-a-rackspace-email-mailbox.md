This article explains how to rename a Rackspace Email mailbox from the Cloud Office Control Panel.


### Prerequisites

- **Applies to:** User
- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Time needed:** Approximately 20 minutes
- **Tools required:** Control Panel access, All devices currently connected to the mailbox

For more information about prerequisite terminology, see [Cloud Office support terminology](/how-to/cloud-office-support-terminology).

### Before you begin

If the mailbox is set up in a [local email client](/how-to/cloud-office-support-terminology) profile such as Outlook or Apple Mail, you should export the user's local profile. After the mailbox is renamed, the local profile must be recreated. Exporting the profile before renaming the mailbox prevents the loss of mail data.

### Rename a Rackspace Email mailbox

1. Log into the [Cloud Office Control Panel](https://cp.rackspace.com/).

2. In the **Rackspace Email** section, click on the link for **Mailboxes**.

3. In the mailbox list, click the link for the mailbox name which you would like to rename.

4. Click the **More** button, expanding the dropdown menu and select **Rename Email Address**.

5. A window will appear asking for the new email address. Enter the **NEW EMAIL** address name, then click **Rename Email Address**.

    - Note: `This email address is already taken`, means the address is already in use as an alias, group list, distribution list, or as a Microsoft Exchange mailbox on this domain. Try a different address.

6. A confirmation message will appear, displaying the old email address and the new email address. If the change is correct, click **OK**.

You have successfully renamed a Rackspace Email mailbox!

Note: The old email address will automatically be made into an alias of the new email address. This means messages sent to the old email address, will deliver to the new email address.

### Update devices to connect to the renamed mailbox

Once the mailbox has been renamed, you must update all devices such as desktop computers and mobile phones to connect to the renamed mailbox. Select your mail client below for instructions on completing this process.

Note: We recommend logging into [apps.rackspace.com](https://apps.rackspace.com/index.php) with the new mailbox address before configuring devices. If you are unable to log in, updated the mailbox password before continuing. See [Change a Rackspace Email mailbox password](/how-to/change-rackspace-email-mailbox-password/#change-a-password-through-cloud-office-control-panel) if you are unable to log into the mailbox.
