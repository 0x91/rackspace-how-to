This article explains how to rename a Rackspace Email mailbox from the Cloud Office Control Panel.

**Note:** If the user mailbox is set up on a local email client profile, for example Outlook or Mac Mail, please ensure that an export of the user's local profile is created. This will prevent lost mail data as the local profile will need to be recreated after the rename.

1. Log in to the [Cloud Office Control Panel](https://cp.rackspace.com/).

2. Click on **Mailboxes** in the Rackspace Email section.

3. Click on the mailbox name you would like to change.

4. In the **User Name** field, delete the existing name and replace with the new name.
