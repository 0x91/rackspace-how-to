This article explains how to rename a Rackspace Email mailbox from the Cloud Office Control Panel.


### Prerequisites

- **Applies to:** User
- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Time needed:** Approximately 20 minutes
- **Tools required:** Control Panel access, All devices currently connected to the mailbox

For more information about prerequisite terminology, see [Cloud Office support terminology](/how-to/cloud-office-support-terminology).

### Before you begin

If the user mailbox is set up on a [local email client](/how-to/cloud-office-support-terminology) profile such as Outlook or Mac Mail, export the user's local profile. After the mailbox is renamed, the local profile must be recreated. Exporting the profile before renaming the mailbox prevents the loss of mail data. See [Update devices to connect to the renamed mailbox](#Update-devices-to-connect-to-the-renamed-mailbox) if the mailbox has already been renamed.
