### Prerequisites

- **Applies to:** User or Administrator
- **Difficulty:** Easy

For more information about prerequisite terminology, see [Cloud Office support terminology](/how-to/cloud-office-support-terminology/).

### Change password through webmail

1. Log in to your mailbox at [apps.rackspace.com](https://apps.rackspace.com/index.php).

   **Note:** If your password is already entered when you get to apps.rackspace.com you must be able manually enter the password for the next steps to work.

    - **Current Password:** The password you just used to log into the mailbox.
    - **New Password:** The new password for the mailbox.
    - **Confirm Password:** Type the new password again exactly as you previously entered it.

    **Warning:** You must update your password on any device that is used to check mail for this mailbox.

### Change password through Cloud Office Control Panel

**Note:** Only Administrators have access to the Cloud Office Control Panel.

1. Log in to the [Cloud Office Control Panel](https://cp.rackspace.com/).
2. In the **Rackspace Email** section, select **Mailboxes**.
3. From the mailbox list, click the blue highlighted mailbox name for which you want to change the password.

4. Under **User Name** you will see two fields:

   - **Password:** Enter the new password
   - **Confirm:** Re-type the new password exactly as you typed it in **Password**

   **Note:** We recommend that you create a password that you have never used before and that remains unique from all your other passwords. Also, the longer your password, the more secure your account is.

5. Click **Submit**.
