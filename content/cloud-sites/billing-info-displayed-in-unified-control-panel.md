The Billing section of your existing control panel will be transitioned
into our new unified control panel. This is a first step towards
incorporating Cloud Sites into the unified control panel.

#### Why have my billing pages disappeared from the Cloud control panel?

Through this change, the Cloud Control Panel's access to credit cards
has been consolidated, and the billing pages have been moved to the
"Rackspace Open Cloud Control Panel".

#### How do I access my billing pages?

Click on the Billing link present under your account in the [Cloud Control Panel](https://manage.rackspacecloud.com/) and you will be taken to the billing
pages present in the [Rackspace Open Cloud Control Panel](https://mycloud.rackspace.com/) where you will be able to perform all the
billing related activities. The Rackspace Open Cloud Control Panel will
open up in a new window or tab without closing your current
window.

#### How do I get back to the original Cloud Control Panel after I am done with viewing the Billing pages?

Once you close the current Rackspace Open Cloud Control
Panel window, you should have the Cloud Control Panel window open in your browser.
