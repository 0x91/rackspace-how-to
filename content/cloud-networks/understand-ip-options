Internet protocol (IP) assigns standardized structure to data packets

transmitted online between computers or servers. The IP addresses used with

Rackspace services depend on the following:

- Data Traffic (inbound vs outbound)

- Access levels (internal vs external)

- Intended use (internet vs within same data center)

- Connected services



The following presents the available IPs, the differences between them, when
and why each is used, and documents explaining how to use them.
