- **Entities** represent any object or resource you want to monitor. You can create an entity for any server or website you want to monitor through UI, API or CLI. This can be set of servers or non-server objects, but most often we see entities that refer to individual servers. As you create new cloud servers, cloud databases, or dedicated devices, entities are created automatically.  For more information, see the API operations reference for the [entity resource](https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-monitoring/v1/developer-guide/#entities-operations).
- **Checks** specify the parts or pieces of the entity that you want to collect metrics on and how you want to do it. In other words, a check returns a group of related metrics. Checks of different types return different sets of metrics, which help you figure out how to collect any data you want. For a complete list of check types see documentation here:  [https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-monitoring/v1/developer-guide/#document-tech-ref-info/check-type-reference](https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-monitoring/v1/developer-guide/#document-tech-ref-info/check-type-reference)
- **Alarms**  contain the rules that determine the state of the alarms as OK, WARNING or CRITICAL. The state change of an alarm will trigger the alert. For details of the alarm, see documentation here:  [https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-monitoring/v1/developer-guide/#document-tech-ref-info/alert-triggers-and-alarms](https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-monitoring/v1/developer-guide/#document-tech-ref-info/alert-triggers-and-alarms)
- **Notifications** and **Notification Plans** are the construct describing how Rackspace Monitoring send alert to you when an alarm state changes.
    - Each  **Notification** specifies two things: to whom the alert should be sent ( **Notification Target** ) and how it should be delivered ( **Notification Type** ). For a complete list of notification types see documentation here:  [https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-monitoring/v1/developer-guide/#document-api-operations/notification-type-operations](https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-monitoring/v1/developer-guide/#document-api-operations/notification-type-operations)
    - A **Notification Plan**  is a group of notifications used by alarms.
