### What is the change log?
For your documentation and auditing purposes, the Firewall Manager v2 has a change log feature built into it. The change log documents the events that have been executed on your Cisco firewall through the Firewall Manager tool. Only changes executed through the Firewall Manager interface are logged in the change log. Changes that are executed by Network Security Rackers who connect to the device directly are not logged in this utility.
