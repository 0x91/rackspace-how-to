Grafana is a popular and beautiful dashboard tool for IT Ops. Rackspace Metrics is designed to meet the functional and performance requirements of enterprise-scale metrics. By integrating with Grafana, Rackspace Metrics changes the cost-structure of metrics collection by replacing the storage component without changing the users' workflow.

With the annotation pushed to Rackspace Metrics showing up in Grafana dashboard, customers can now gain insight into the events that might be the cause of the changes in the performance graph.

### Detailed Information

The concept of "Annotation" can be traced back easily to a blog post by Etsy team, where they use it to make events like release to show up in the performance graph, often providing valuable insights into the changes on the graph.

Through Grafana, Rackspace Metrics users can create dashboard that can help identify the performance changes in the system (see [Create a Grafana dashboard for Rackspace Metrics](https://support.rackspace.com/how-to/create-a-grafana-dashboard-for-rackspace-metrics/).  While detection is the first step towards managing the application, the next step is often to figure out what has changed.

With annotation support, users can submit change event to show along with the graph, adding additional information for the graph on the dashboard. See [Request an annotation](https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/metrics/v2/developer-guide/#retrieve-an-annotation) for additional information. (Mock-ups below)

#### Ingesting Annotation through API

Annotation is submitted through /events API end point:

    curl https://global.metrics-ingest.api.rackspacecloud.com/v2.0/737305/events -X POST -d '{
          "what": "app03 deployment",
          "when": 1452105873000,
          "tags": "deployment",
          "data": "deploying prod"
        }
    ' -H 'X-Auth-Token: e0247392bdd04ef0afa4f0b868fe99a4' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Accept: application/json'

***Note**: The value for the "when" field is the epoch time in milliseconds.  To convert the date strings to and from epoch time, you can use the "date" method in Mac or [http://www.epochconverter.com/](http://www.epochconverter.com/)

    > date +%s
    1452101351
     
    > date -j +%s -f "%a %b %d %T %Z %Y" "Mon Jan  4 12:43:57 PST 2016"
    1451940237
     
    > date -j -f "%m/%d/%Y %T %Z" "01/04/2016 12:43:57 PST" +%s
    1451940237
     
    > date -r 1451940237
    Mon Jan  4 12:43:57 PST 2016

The new annotation shows up in Grafana.

### (optional) Retrieve Annotation from API

If you prefer to use the API command to retreive your annotation, use the following command.

    curl -i -X GET 'http://global.metrics.api.rackspacecloud.com/v2.0/737305/events/getEvents?from=1452105863000&until=1452105883000' \
    > -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    > -H "Accept: application/json" \
    > -H "X-Auth-Token: AABlXo00elZk9FEtn2MGz8QQ9v3GD86AEZ_LbMe3yHyC43GE9pTFNXqVxYLq92FPwED0sDkYS8c1R222AWMS1y4nqTG3NmRofHmj4S0lfPsz3YXBTtFaXDac"
