When you have decided that Rackspace Fanatical Support&reg; is for you, it's time to sign up for a Rackspace account. The process of signing up for an account is simple. However, it’s important to understand the verification process and account ownership if you’re new Rackspace customer.

### Before you sign up

Before you sign up for a Rackspace account, ask yourself the following questions:

**Which cloud or Rackspace product are you using?**

Rackspace supports a several different clouds including Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, as well as Rackspace’s own suite of cloud products including Rackspace Private Cloud and Rackspace Public Cloud. The sign up process changes depending on what product you are using. Use the following list to find the right sign up process for your chosen Rackspace product or service.

-	[Fanatical Support for AWS and Rackspace Public Cloud](#fanatical-support-for-aws-or-rackspace-public-cloud)
-	[Rackspace Email and applications](#rackspace-email-and-applications)
-	[Office 365](#office-365)

**Who will be the primary user/account owner?**

The information provided to Rackspace during the signup process is associated with the primary user of the account. The primary user is the owner of the account and is the account user that has the ability to add and remove additional users, set permissions and view or change billing information. In addition, the primary user is the main point of contact for the account. For example, any user can create a support ticket, but only the account owner will be notified when a support ticket is created, updated or marked as solved.

If the account is for a business or organization, make sure the person who will need to manage the account is the individual who signs up.

**Is your sign up information accurate?**

When users are sharing resources the impact of a malicious user can be significant. That’s why we take the security of our public cloud very seriously and our security precautions start with the signup process. We employ a series of industry standard, enterprise-class tools to help verify and validate all account requests as quickly as possible. To make sure the security process is as painless as it is effective, Rackspace has a global team on duty 24/7 that manages the signup and validation process. This means calling customers to verify information within minutes of receiving your application. The most common delay in this process is not receiving accurate contact information from our new customers. You can ensure the quick processing of your account by double-checking that all of the information you provide is accurate.

Rackspace uses the following information to create your account:

- Email address
- Unique username
- Password (8 to 19 characters with at least one uppercase, one lowercase and one number)
- Security question and answer
- First and last name of primary account owner
- Company or Organization (Optional)
- Physical address
- Phone number
- Valid credit card
