you must export the data before deleting the mailbox. Data exports must be performed through a [local mail client](/how-to/cloud-office-support-terminology) such as Outlook.

### Delete vs. Disable

Disable a mailbox - This DOES NOT remove a mailbox from your account. It prevents access to the mailbox. If a mailbox is disabled it remains on your account
and you continue to be billed for that mailbox. The mailbox will still retain its previous data and will still receive new mail sent to it.

change reflected on your bill.
