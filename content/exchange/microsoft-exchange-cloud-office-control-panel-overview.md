Welcome to Rackspace Cloud Office Control Panel! After you sign up for
Microsoft Exchanges services through Rackspace, the first thing
to do is log in to your Cloud Office Control Panel. This article
provides a brief overview of the features you have access to in the control panel, which you can access at
<https://cp.rackspace.com/> for new Cloud Office customers or
<https://my.rackspace.com/> for UK and MyRackspace customers.

After you're logged into the Control Panel, you will see a variety of
sections that showcase the products for which you have signed up. Each product/service box has a variety of
options and tools to choose from, including **Rackspace Email**, **Microsoft Exchange**, **Microsoft Office 365**, **Domains**, and **News & Alerts**. As you sign up for additional products, each
product will show here to enable you to manage it directly from the landing page.
