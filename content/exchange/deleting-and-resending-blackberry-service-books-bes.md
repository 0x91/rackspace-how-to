Service books determine which services are
available on your BlackBerry&reg; device.  At times, the service books
become corrupt and will cause the Blackberry Enterprise Server (BES) to
fail upon synchronizing updates of PIM data such as Calendar or Address
Book entries. These issues are frequently resolved by deleting and
resending the service books to the device.  Please have the user delete
all service books starting with the &ldquo;Desktop&rdquo; from their Blackberry
device. Once completed, resend the service books from your Cloud Office
control panel.

To delete the service books, follow the steps for your model of Blackberry:

### Blackberry Curve

1.  In the device Settings &gt; Options &gt;
    Advanced Options.
2.  Click **Service Book**s and highlight a
    service book.
3.  Press the **Menu** key, click **Delete** & confirm
    **Delete**.



### Blackberry Torch 

1.  On the **Home** screen or in a folder, click the
    **Options** icon.
2.  **Click Device**&gt; **Advanced System Settings** &gt;
    **Service Book**.
3.  Highlight service book and Press the **Menu**
    key
4.  Click **Delete** & confirm **Delete**.



**Once the service books have been removed from the device,
they should be resent to the device via the control panel
following:**

1.  Mouse over the Go to section drop-down menu and select
    Microsoft Exchange.
