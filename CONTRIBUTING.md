# Contributing to the Rackspace How-To Site
-------------------------------------------

This document describes our general procedure for maintaining source code for documents published at https://support.rackspace.com/how-to/.

Alternatively, you can tell us what you want to have changed by creating an issue. To do that, click "Issues" near the top of this page.

----

Content is grouped into one directory per product.
Each directory contains one file per article.

Find the directory for the product you are working on.

Make any edits you may need directly through the GitHub website, through the GitHub desktop client, or on the command line.

When you finish editing an article, you must commit the edit so GitHub can produce a pull request. In the GitHub website or GitHub desktop client, create a commit message following the guidelines below:

- Provide a brief description of the change.
- Use imperative mood. For example, "Add a paragraph about ..." vs "Added a paragraph about ...".
- If you make a complex edit, explain why you are making the edit. For example, if you update an article to change list formatting, provide a commit message that explains the change: *Change bulleted list to numeric to show clear progression of steps*

  Note: Be sure that you are making commits to a branch. In the GitHub desktop client or website interface, you commit to a branch by selecting the **Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request** option below your commit message.

Create a pull request for your branch.

After you commit your change, create a pull request so that your change can be reviewed. Depending on the review feedback, you might be asked to make additional changes, or given the OK to merge your updates.

After you complete any requested changes, commit them to the branch and merge your pull request.
