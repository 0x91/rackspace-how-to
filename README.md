# Rackspace How-To Content Repository
-------------------------------------

This README describes our general procedure for maintaining source code for documents published at https://support.rackspace.com/how-to/. 

Alternatively, you can tell us what you want to have changed by creating an issue. To do that, click "Issues" near the top of this page.

----

Content is grouped into one directory per product. 
Each directory contains one file per article.

Find the directory for the product you are working on. 

**DO NOT FORK the repo.**

Make any edits you may need directly through the Github website, through the Github desktop client, or on the command line. 

When you finish editing an article, you must commit the edit so Github can produce a pull request. In the Github website or Github desktop client, create a commit message following the guidelines below:

- Provide a brief description of the change.
- Use imperative mood. For example, "Add a paragraph about &mldr;" vs "Added a paragraph about &mldr;".
- If you make a complex edit, explain why you are making the edit. For example, if you changing the formatting of an article because a   list should be ordered instead of unordered, say, "Switch list in middle of article to ordered so that there is clear progression of   steps".

  Note: Be sure that you are making commits to a branch. In the Github desktop client and the Github website, this can be achieved by   selecting the **Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request** option below your commit message.

Create a pull request for your branch. 

During the audit phase of the migration, after a pull request is made, you are responsible for merging the pull request.

Commit any new changes to the branch and merge your pull request once you have completed your edits.
